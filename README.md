# Project-Titanic
Step 1: Using the dataset from Titanic incident, clean, modify and format data to be able to use for training Machine Learning Models.  
Step 2: Choose machine learning models (SGD, KNN and LogisticRegression) and train them using data.
Step 3: Use the best model to predict the data that has anonymous values of Survivability.
